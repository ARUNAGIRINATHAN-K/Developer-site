                Programming is a skill that is becoming increasingly sought after in the job market.
                The Government in India has been transforming the digital landscape through the Digital India Programme, with a
                focus on expanding digital access and training across the country.
                With the high rate at which digital technology is expanding, computer programming skills are likely to continue to be in high
                demand across many professional industries.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Anyone who interacts with technology should have at least a basic understanding of how software<br>
                functions. With a background in programming, you can get a job coding, designing software, data<br>
                architecture, or creating intuitive user interfaces.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But what language should you learn? You'll find a seemingly infinite number of free programming
                languages to learn and develop projects online. With the technology field growing exponentially each
                year, the internet is a great place to start when exploring the latest developments or discovering a new skill. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Whichever language you learn, you may find it helpful to take notes or draw diagrams detailing the steps you're taking and why. Programmers need to be able to communicate their process to non-technical stakeholders, but taking notes can also be a great learning tool.
